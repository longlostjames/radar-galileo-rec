DUE TO THE POSSIBLE CHANGES IN THE H_NOT_V SIGNAL AFTER POWERING DOWN
TWO VERSIONS OF THE ACQUISITION EXECUTABLE HAVE BEEN CREATED
1) radar-galileo-rec_correctHV
2) radar-galileo-rec_reverseHV

THE HEADER FILE HAS CHANNEL INPUTS SET TO ENSURE ZDR IS POSITIVE FOR OBLATE PARTICLES
#define CHAN_Ic       2
#define CHAN_Qc       3
#define CHAN_Ix       0
#define CHAN_Qx       1

THE TWO VERSIONS OF THE ACQUISITION CODE INTERPRET A LOW H_NOT_V SIGNAL TO INDICATE:
1) HORIZONTAL PULSE FIRST (correctHV)
2) VERTICAL PULSE FIRST (reverseHV)
THIS DECISION IS BASED ON THE FIRST SAMPLE OF THE FIRST PULSE FROM THE DAQ CARD
THE FIRST 20 SAMPLES OF EACH ACQUISITION ARE OUTPUT TO THE TEMPORARY FILE
/tmp/test.txt
IT SEEMS THAT 'CORRECT OPERATION' IS A LOW H_NOT_V SIGNAL INDICATING HORIZONTAL FIRST

AS A TEMPORARY SOLUTION, THE APPROPRIATE EXECUTABLE MAY BE COPIED TO THE ACTIVE EXECUTABLE
e.g.     cp radar-galileo-rec_correctHV radar-galileo-rec
BEFORE THE ACQUISITION IS STARTED AS NORMAL
i.e.    ./local_start-radar-galileo.sh --noserial

PLEASE RECORDED ANY CHANGES TO THE ACTIVE EXECUTABLE BELOW:
20170613 22:49 (1) correctHV : JCN
20170627 10:15 (2) reverseHV : JCN
